# contract-creator

The purpose of this Node CLI app is to create equity contracts for inclusion in a Thinkorswim watchlist or symbol lookup frame. I made this as I struggled with mass importing equity contracts into a watchlist created on Thinkorswim (TD Ameritrade's trading platform). Thinkorwim does not currently have a native implementation for searching and adding multiple contracts. Contract-creator resolves this issue.
